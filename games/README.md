# Command Line games implemented in Ruby to practice OOP

I have implemented these games in AppAcademy when I started learning Ruby in order to practice OOP.  
However, I remember being stuck so many times even when I was following their instructions on how to build the game.  
As a result, I had to sneak from time to time on the solutions to get a glimpse of the next step.  

After reading the books Practical Object Oriented Design and Design Patterns in Ruby, I decided to return to re-asses my OOP skills.  
This time, without any instructions. I'll start from scratch using sequence diagrams to decide on proper classes and methods and refactor all the way.  

I am gonna implement some games that I left for being overwhelmed by their implementation, and hopefully, refactor the rest I have already implemented.  

According to my plan, After finishing the rest of the games, I'll go read Test Driven Development in Ruby.  
After reading the book, I'll come back here to add some specs and refactor it as if I am TDDing it.
